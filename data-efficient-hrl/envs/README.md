# Ant Environments for RL

Taken almost entirely from the [Tensorflow Models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/efficient-hrl/environments) repository, which is itself inspired by the work done by [RlLab](https://github.com/rll/rllab/blob/master/rllab/envs/mujoco/). Minor edit: visual observations, which we needed for some our own work.
