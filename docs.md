## Documentation for my implementation of standard RL algorithms

**Note: this documentation currently does not include the hierarchical algorithms which are the core work of this thesis**

Documentation can be generated very easily - just run:

`make docs`

You will then have documentation for the project and the Watershed environment:

1. Project documentation: `docs/src/index.html`
2. Watershed documentation: `gym-watershed/docs/gym_watershed/index.html`
